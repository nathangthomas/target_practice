# Target Practice
This project came about as a fun way to merge something fun I was doing when taking breaks from coding and job searching (sling shot target practice) and merging it with my passion for software and interest in hardware.

## Getting started
If you do not already have the Arduino IDE download and install it from here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
Next, youâ€™ll need to `fork` the repo as your own. Once you have done that, copy and paste the code into your Arduino IDE and upload the code to your Arduino.

## Functionality
#### Iteration One
Iteration 1 uses a LCD screen and a simple circuit to track how many times a target as been hit or missed.
